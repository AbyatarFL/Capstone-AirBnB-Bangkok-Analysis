## Project Synopsis
This is a **Capstone Project** focused on data analysis (Data Preparation, Understanding & Feature Engineering) and data visualization. The goal of this project is to provide recommendations and insights on how to optimize the popularity and total revenue for AirBnB owners in the city of Bangkok based on the data. The tools used to carry out the analysis are Python (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn & Matplotlib) and also Tableau to create interactive dashboards.

## Objective & Motivation
According to the **Ministry of Tourism and Sports of Thailand**, the number of tourist visits to Thailand will continue to **increase** even until 2025, this could be a golden opportunity for AirBnB owners. However, many of them are still unable to optimize the level of popularity of their AirBnB, resulting in **less than optimal the income they earn**. Therefore we will find out what factors can influence the level of popularity (Number of Reviews and Occupancy Rate) & total income from an AirBnB.

- Make sure to give a fair price that is still profitable. Approximately between 1575.89 - 1658.04. But it still has to be adjusted to the price range in a neighbourhood and room type. ![image](https://github.com/AbyatarFL/Capstone-AirBnB-Bangkok-Analysis/assets/109770559/a10d9942-a90e-4646-8ba1-87f38084c15b)
- Provide good services so that customers will be happy to give a good reviews. ![image](https://github.com/AbyatarFL/Capstone-AirBnB-Bangkok-Analysis/assets/109770559/60c13ef2-3d21-4cfb-af2f-cd99297cddb3)
- Since AirBnB caters mostly to tourists & they won't be staying long in Thailand, setting a minimum nights stay is also something that AirBnB owners need to consider to attract more customers. ![image](https://github.com/AbyatarFL/Capstone-AirBnB-Bangkok-Analysis/assets/109770559/4cbd3807-fab2-442b-ae27-8f12d0301796)
- Choose the right location to rent out AirBnB. Close to the city center (Sukhumvit Area) is the right choice to attract more customers. ![image](https://github.com/AbyatarFL/Capstone-AirBnB-Bangkok-Analysis/assets/109770559/e09787cf-3c3b-48e4-824a-cc3782ecc8e0)
- Entire House/Apt is the type of room most sought after by tourists, make sure to consider this when you want to rent out AirBnB. ![image](https://github.com/AbyatarFL/Capstone-AirBnB-Bangkok-Analysis/assets/109770559/ac87905c-f09e-4e27-8716-b52619ff8f5b)
